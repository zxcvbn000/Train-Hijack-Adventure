<p>You are a terrorist part of the Sultan Regime (not based on any real terrorist groups) who has to make his/her way from Afghanistan to Europe as an illegal immigrant, and hijack the Trans-European high speed rail at its peak hour. (not based on any real train lines). Around 70 miles in, the train will make a wide turn around a mountain, your goal is to speed up the train and derail it, in a plot to murder the prime minister of Hungary (not based on any real prime ministers), who is planning to issue sanctions against oil exported from the middle east to the European Union. The Sultan Regime controls a huge part of oil trade in the Middle East, and this is a very important job for them. Your own survival is your choice, but only comes after the master plan.</p>
